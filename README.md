# Arduino-Wireless-Communication-Controlling-LED-Brightness-with-nRF24L01
This project demonstrates how to use Arduino and the nRF24L01 RF module for wireless communication. Specifically, it reads the value from a potentiometer on the transmitter side and controls the brightness of an LED on the receiver side.
